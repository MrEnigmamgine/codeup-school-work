Or maybe they are useful in purely analysis, in understanding and being able to explain what is going on, but you have not found them useful in your supervised model. But to determine if they are useful, you must analyze the clusters created! run statistical tests and visualize the clusters, comparing the mean log error across the different clusters. Is there a significant difference between them? Plot them! Put the log error on the y-axis, cluster on th x-axis, and visualize through a violin plot, a catplot, a swarmplot, or others. Other reminders: label your clusters with something meaningful; the numeric ID given to distinguish one cluster from another does not represent a numeric measure, so don't use those values in modeling - dummy variables are the key; you don't have to use every cluster of a clustering model as features, you can select just the one(s) that show significant relationship(s) with the target variable.  \n",
