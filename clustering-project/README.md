# Zillow data logerror clustering project
A school project to build a machine learning model to predict logerror using clustering methods and regression and deliver a report on the indicators used in the model.

## About the project

The project will attempt to develop a clear understanding of where Zillow's model struggles to predict accurately.  Then hopefully use that insight to accurately predict Zillow's error.

### Steps to reproduce
First download a copy of each file or clone this repository.

To run this project you will need to fulfill one of the following requirements:
 > An environment file named `env.py` in the same directory as the other files.  The enviornment file should be structured the same as below and should contain your unique credentials to CodeUp's SQL server.
 ```py
hostname='data.codeup.com'
username='your_username'
password='your_password'
```
> A csv file named `data.csv` in the same directory as the other files.  You can download a copy of the data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/zillow-prize-1/data)

You will also need to ensure the proper libraries are installed in your python environment.  You can install the libraries easily by running the following command in your python shell:
```py
%pip install numpy
%pip install pandas
%pip install matplotlib
%pip install seaborn
%pip install plotly
%pip install scipy
%pip install sklearn
```

### Goals

Zillow, a real-estate listing website, is looking to improve their model that predicts property value.  By applying a model that can accurately predict their model's error, they can adjust the predictions of their existing model, resulting in a more accurate prediction.

*Agile Story Format:*
> As a `real-estate listing website`, 
> I want `predictions of my model's logerror`
> so that I can `reduce my model's logerror`.


### Deliverables

Since the company wants two different things that means that we will need at least two deliverables in our final product:  
 1. A storytelling document that explains at least one driver of property value and makes recommendations on how to discover further.
 2. A machine learning model that predicts the property value that will perform well in production.

Because this is a classroom project there are some additional requirements that will need to be met.  

For the storytelling document:
 - It will need to be delivered in a jupyter notebook named `Final_Report.ipynb`
    - Between five and seven visualizations included.
    - It must include 2 statistical tests

For the machine learning model:
 - It should be demonstrated in the `Final_Report.ipynb` notebook.
 - It should be scripted easily reproducible in a `model.py` helper library.
 - Since Zillow is looking for inspiration for improving their own model, I will try to create models that use finesse gained from exploration, rather than a brute-force methodology.



### Initial Hypothesis
Just like with any scientific endeavor, it is important to form a hypothesis when approaching a Data Science project.  The hypothesis gives us something concrete to start testing against.  How truthful the initial hypothesis turns out to be is ultimately unimportant since this is an iterive process and there will likely be many hypotheses throughout the life of the project.  The important part is to give us a starting point.  For the purposes of this project my initial hypothesis will be:

> Certain groups of homes are more affected by logerror than others.
